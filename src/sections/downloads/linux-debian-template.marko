            The installation process described here utilizes an installation shell script. The script will configure the required systemd unit to auto-start Sonarr.
            It'll deploy the binaries in <code>/opt/Sonarr</code> and the configuation data will be stored in <code>/var/lib/sonarr</code>.
        </p>
        <migration-alert>
            The Sonarr v4 package overwrites v3's systemd unit if present.
            It's advisable to make a backup of the v3 data first and uninstall the previous <code>sonarr</code> package.<br/>
